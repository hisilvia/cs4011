Detail:
Create a zip file of the project. Zip is the only accepted file format. 7zip and other formats that require 3rd party software will not be accepted.

If for whatever reason you cannot create a zip file, please let us know and we will figure it out.

Before you compress your project, remove the node_modules folder!!!!!


Requirements:

See the video below for a demo.

Create a multi-page react website using react-router, any of the mentioned component libraries (or regular CSS if you're a CSS wizard), and Storybook.

Must include at least 2 pages

About me
Hobbies/Pets
 

The “About me” page should include a picture and the text from your introduction post.

The picture does not need to be an actual picture of you.

 

The “hobbies” or “pets” page must use a re-usable react component for each hobby/pet.

The react component should include at least 3 props

Title
Description
ImgSrc
Hobbies/Pets should be stored in a hard-coded array of objects. (See below)

The hobbies/pets components should be rendered from an array of objects using map.

 

All pages should include a Navigation Bar. This navigation bar will allow the user to navigate to each page.

 

There should be Storybook stories for the Navigation Bar and the Hobby/Pet component.

 

Navigation Bar Story

Does not have the provider error discussed in the last lecture video
 

Hobby/Pet component Story

The hobby/pet component should have controls at the bottom of the page to manually control the props
 

Overall Look

A component library such as Material UI should be used
OR you can create your own custom CSS for the page if you're good at that
This is subjective, but it should be evident that effort was put into the look of the page
You can recreate the look of the demonstration project that I made if you want. But I encourage you to be creative!
 

Page should be free of any console errors and warnings. In particular, "Each child in a list should have a unique "key" prop"
